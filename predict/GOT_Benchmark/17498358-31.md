We chose eigenvector centrality over betweenness, as the former is more suitable for identifying global languages according to our definition: a global language is a language that are connected to other hub languages (such as English in the example from the book translations network above), not a language that serve as the only gateway to many peripheral languages (such as Russian in the above example). 
We also had a practical reason for preferring eigenvector centrality over betweenness centrality: the latter is a measure that is unable to differentiate among more peripheral languages, since most languages get a betweenness score of zero (see Figure S3 below). Eigenvector centrality, on the other hand, can help us differentiate between the positions of languages in the GLN at all levels of centrality, not only among the most central languages.
