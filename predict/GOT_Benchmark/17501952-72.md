\hline Light – associated with The One – become Dark, then becoming something almost indescribable, but apparently taking on the appearance of what other cultures would have termed “Hell”, or “the Abyss” – or something else. What is happening? What is being created? The sun? A sun? The Earth? Stars and planets? At this moment in time, it would be tempting to suggest that the subject sees the birth of the universe, but only later will it become clear that this is – not yet – the case; the creation event here is something else.  \\

5. [Then,] out of the Light [...] a Holy Word (Logos) descended on that Nature. And upwards to the height from the Most Nature leaped forth pure Fire; it was light, swift and active too. The Air, too, being light, followed after the Fire; from out of the Earth-and-Water rising up to Fire so that it seemed to hang from it. 
But Earth-and-Water stayed mingled with each other in such a manner that no one could discern Earth from Water. Yet they were moved to hear by reason of the Spirit-Word (Logos) pervading them. 
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline The creation myth of the Hermetic is standard for ancient cultures. In short, Light creates the Logos, out of which the four elements will be created. In this case, the first element is Earth, then Fire, then Air, then Water.  \\

6. Then Man-Shepherd said to me: Did you understand this Vision? 
No; that shall I know, I said. 
That Light, He said, am I, your God, Mind, prior to Most Nature which appeared from Darkness; the Light-Word (Logos) [that appeared] from Mind is Son of God. 
What then? – I said. 
Know that what you sees in you and hears is the Lord’s Word (Logos); but Mind is Father-God.
