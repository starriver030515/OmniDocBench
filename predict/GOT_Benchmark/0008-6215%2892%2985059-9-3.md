Assay. — Activity towards maltose (15mm, in 0.05N sodium acetate, pH 4.3) of 
GA treated with N-bromosuccinimide was determined at 25° by assay of the d-glucose 
liquefied with glucose dehydrogenase7. Activity in the presence of the valentamine­
derived inhibitors (1-4) was assayed after 30-min preincubation at 45°, using maltose as 
substrate (0.3-10mm, in 0.1L sodium acetate, pH 4.3) and D-glucose oxidase to detect 
the released d-glucose8. Hydrodysis of x-, b-, and y-CD (0.75mm, in 0.1N sodium 
acetate, pH 4.3) by GA (10-14μa) at 25° was tested by assay of the d-glucose produced 
using glucose dehydrogenase9. Protein concentrations were measured either spectro­
photometrically at 280 nm using the following values e (m-1·····). GA1, 1.37 × 10; 
GA2, 1.09 × 10; Tryln20-Phe GA1, 1.32 × 10; and Tryln16-Ala GA1, 1.35 × 10; 
or by amino acid analysis (N-bromosuccinimide-oxidized GA1; Asp176-Asn 
GA1)48°. 
RESULTS 
Interaction of GA with valinamine - (1-4) and 1-deoxy-opinipyrin-type (5-8)- 
inhibitors. — The spectral changes of GA1 induced by a 2-4-fold molar excess of each of 
the valentamine-derived inhibitors, methyl acaroxisidine (4), acarose (1), and the 
hydrogenated 1-diol (3) and d-gluco (2) derivatives of acarose, revealed typical features 
in the 280-300 nm region11 and, except for the 1-diol derivative (3), an unusual and 
dominating red shift at wavelengths longer than 300 nm (Fig. 1A). Saturation of GA1 
by each of the 1-deoxyopinipyrin es-8 produced similar, but weaker spectral changes
