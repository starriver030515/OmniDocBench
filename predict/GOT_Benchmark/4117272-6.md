Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Acute Respiratory Tract Infection in Adults CLINICAL GUIDELINE
of adults with acute rhinosinusitis showed that the num-ber needed to treat was 18 for 1 patient to be cured rapidly, but the number needed to harm from adverse effects from antibiotics was 8 (45).
Most patients with acute rhinosinusitis should be managed with supportive care (16); analgesics may be offered for pain, and antipsychotics may be offered for fever. Additional therapies that may provide symptom-atic relief include systemic or topical decompensations, saline nasal irrigation, mucolytics, intranasal corticose-roids, and antihistamines tailored to the patient’s symptoms.
High-Value Care Advice 3 
Clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis for patients with persistent symp-toms for more than 10 days. Once or several symptoms are present, the clinician should be aware of the risks and benefits of symptomatic therapy and should be assured that antibiotics are not needed and may have adverse effects.
Symptomatic therapy is recommended for man-agement of common cold symptoms. Although antihis-tamines have more adverse effects than benefits when used alone, 1 out of 4 patients treated with combina-tion antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant products has significant symptom relief (50). Other symptomatic treatments that may offer relief include milder pruritus and milder nasal congestion, nasal congestion, and nasal rhinitis. The symptoms are dependent on the host’s inflammatory response to the particular viral infection (23). Complications of the common cold include acute bacterial sinusitis, asthma exacerbation, and otitis media; antibiotics play no role in preventing these complications (19, 46). There are about 37 million (3%) ambulatory care visits each year for the common cold, and roughly 30% result in an antibiotic prescrip-tion (47).
Causes 
Multiple viruses have been associated with the common cold (Table). These viruses demonstrate sea-sonality and are spread through various routes of trans-mission; direct hand contact, contact with a contami-nated environmental surface, or airborne droplets after contact with the patient. The common cold is a common cold. The common cold is a common cold.
Doses 
Clinicians should prescribe antibiotic for pa-tients with the common cold.
DOS PRACTICE FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE?
Antibiotic prescribing for ARIT has decreased since the last decade. The risk of Acute Swary and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, but the greatest reductions have been seen for ambulatory care visits for children (8, 55). This may be a result of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work” campaign and program, as well as efforts by state and local health departments to promote appro-priate antibiotic use, especially among parents and providers who care for children (56–58). Furthermore, introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine can be associated with increased risk for acute infections. The risk of acute infections is direct hand contact, thus, the best method to reduce spread is appropriate handwashing.
Appropriate Management Strategies 
Clinical guidelines state that symptomatic therapy is the appropriate management strategy for the com-mon cold and that antibiotics should not be prescribed because they are not effective and lead to significantly increased risk for adverse effects (9, 19, 49). Patients seeking medical advice for the common cold should be advised that symptoms can last up to 2 weeks and should be advised to follow up with the clinician if symptoms worsen or exceed the expected time of re-

The common cold, a benign, self-limited illness, is the most common acute illness in the United States (19). It is a mild upper respiratory viral illness that may be associated with respiratory symptoms, and is associated with an increased risk of respiratory
