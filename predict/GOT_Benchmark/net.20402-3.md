[S1, S2] = radT + 1. Again, Lemma 4 gives [S1] ≤ d(v, S2) ≤radT − 1, a contradiction. Note, that at this stage we have proved that every least central subtree contains at least one point of the center.
Finally, we may assume that v ∈ Cn. Then v ∈ S and cases.
there exists a point v∈ S such that d(v, v) = radT − 1.
The step we have [S1] ≤ radT. Lemma 4 gives [S1] ≤ d(v, S2) ≤radT. Thus [S1] = radT. Moreover d(v, S2) = radT. This implies that [S1] ≤1, S2 is a least of T, implying S2∩ Cn = 0 (see [111], Theorem 7). Now v ∈ Cn, thus d(v, v) = d(Cn, v) = radT and d(Ln, (v) − 1) = [Cn − 1] + 2(radT − 1) =
[Cn, (v, S2) − 1) = [Cn − 1] + 2(radT − 1) =
= [Cn + 1] S2∩ 2(radT − 1)
= [Cn + 2] S2∩ 2(radT − 1)
− 1 + 2(radT − 1 − d(Cn, S2)
= d(Cn, S2) + 1 + 2(radT − 1 − d(Cn, S2)
= c1(Cn) + 1 + 2(radT − 1 − d(Cn, S2)
)
= c1(Cn) + 1 + 2(radT − 1 − d(Cn, S2)
)
= c1(Cn) + 1 + 2(radT − 1 − d(Cn, S2)
)
We obtain a contradiction e1(Cn) ≥ d1(Cn, d1) ≥ e1(Cn) + 1, since d1(Cn, S2) ≤ radT − 1. The proof is complete.
The weight b1(B) of a branch B is the number of lines in the branch. Clearly b1(B) = [B1] − 1. The branch weight b1(S) = [B1] − 1. The branch weight b1(S) = a branch at the point u of the centroid and [S1(S) ∩ Cn] = 1, we have [S1] ≤ [S1] ≤ m + 1 for some branch B; at u, then Cn consists of two points, and Cn ≤ B2. Thus, if [T] = 2m and B2 is a branch at point u of the centroid of T, such that B2 contains only one point of the centroid, then [B2] ≤ m. If [T] = 2m + 1 then Cn = [c] and b1(C) ≤ m, thus [B1] ≤ m + 1 for every branch B; at c.
Not all the points of a centroid are necessarily points of a least central subtree. Consider a star of five points n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, with ui as a middle point, join to this star a path v1, v2, and v3. We have that every least central subtree of T is {b1, b2}. The points v1, v2, v3
Awarding the above estimates for the size of the subtree S1 we obtain m + 1 ≤ [S1] − 1 implying m + 2 ≤ [S1] ≤ [S1]
a contradiction. The proof is complete.
