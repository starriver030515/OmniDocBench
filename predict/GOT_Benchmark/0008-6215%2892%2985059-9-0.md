Roles of the aromatic side chains in the binding of sub- 
strates, inhibitors, and cyclomalto-oligosaccharides to the 
glucosamine have been shown by perturbation 
difference spectroscopy, chemical modification, and 
mutagenesis*

ASTRACT
The roles of the aromatic side chains of the glucocomylase from Aspergillus niger in the binding of 
ligands, as determined by difference spectroscopy using four types of inhibitors (a) valamamine-derived, (b) 
1-deoxyquiniline, (c) a-glucone1-1,5-lactone, and (d) malitol, two types of disaccharide substrates (a) 
a-1-(a-4)-linked and (b) a-1-(a-4)-linked, and three cyclomalto-oligosaccharides (cyclodextrins, CD) are
