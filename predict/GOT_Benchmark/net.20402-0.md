In this article, we consider the logismatitude of subtrees of the tree. The minimal subtrees in the logismatitude center are least central subtrees. We show that for every number of subtrees, we can find the least central subtree and at least one point of the centroid of the tree.

1. INTRODUCTION
The middle part of a graph has important applications in transportation (facility planning and location problems). Much research has been devoted to defining that middle part of a tree, beginning with [4]; see also [3, 8, 14–16]. The solu-tions are usually limited to special types of middle parts of a tree, such as central points or central paths (see [2]) or subtrees of order k (see [5, 6]).
In [11], new centrality concepts, subtrees S of a tree T is central subtrees were introduced in the original conceptualizations of central subtrees of a tree, and powers that the intersection of two least central subtrees were introduced in the original conceptualizations of central subtrees of all subtrees of T. It can be a point, or a path, or some other kind of subtree such that the subtree is the most central when compared with all subtrees of the tree.
The logismatitude of subtrees was introduced in [11]; see also [10]. The underlying graph G1 is a median graph [1, 7, 9]. The graph center of the median logismatitude G1 is closely related to central subtrees. The set of all central subtrees is, in fact, the set of central points of the graph G1.
However the graph center C(G1) is not a proper solution to the problem of finding the middle part of a tree. Let [A] denote the number of points of the graph A. It is well known that for trees T of size T[Y] = n paths have the least number of subtrees and stars have the largest number of subtrees. Thus J3(n + 1) ≤ G1 ≤ 2n−1 + n − 1; see [16]. In the case of stars almost all points of the graph G1 are central. Only leaves iv1 and compartments of leaves T∨vi are excluded from
the logismatitude center. Even the star itself is a point of the
logismatitude center. Thus the cardinality of the underlying graph center varies considerably: 1 ≤ [C(G1)] ≥ 2n−1 + n − 1 + For all paths the repeated procedures of stripping away leaves gives all central subtrees. Again the path itself is an element of the logismatitude center. In addition, the graph center C(G1) need not be a connected subgraph of the median logismatitude graph G1.
Thus, the graph center of G1 (the set of central subtrees) is too large for effective treatment of our problem. Therefore, we have adopted another optimization criterion. Among all subtrees lying in the logismatitude center, the best is the one with minimal size. That is our least central subtree. For paths and stars this modification resolves the problem. In both cases, the least central subtree is unique and coincides with the least central subtree.
Reference [11] describes the general properties of a least central subtree of a tree, gives some connections between the least central subtree and the center/centroid of a tree, and proves that the intersection of two least central subtrees is nonempty. In this article, we refine the methods of proof used in [11]. We describe exactly how the center and centroid and least central subtrees are interconnected. Our main results prove that every least central subtree of a tree contains the center and at least one point of the centroid of the tree. In particular, we do not need a priori knowledge of the results in [11] between least central subtrees, the center, and the centroid.
2. PRELIMINARIES
For every tree T there is a logismatitude L(T) of subtrees of T, where the meta S1 S2 of subtrees S1 and S2 equals the subtree induced by the intersection of the point sets of S1 and S
