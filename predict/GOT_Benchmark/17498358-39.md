We determine a person’s country of birth using present-day international borders. For example, we code Italy as the country of birth for author Ipoliotto Niveo, although Italy was unified only shortly before his death in 1861 and at the time of his birth his native Padua was part of the Austrian Empire. In some cases, this method produces unintuitive results. The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus was born in Italicarnassus (present-day Bodrum, Turkey) and would earn points for Turkish, while Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the Republic of Turkey, was born in Thessaloniki, present-day Greece, and would earn points for Greek. Because our language distribution statistics are from the last few years, we include only people born in 1800 and later, to reduce the effect of geopolitical and cultural changes on our mapping of countries to languages. To match the year limitation of the Human Accomplishment dataset, we also set 1950 as the latest year of birth for the Wikipedia dataset. 
Despite some inaccuracies, using present-day countries provides a consistent mapping of people who lived over a period of several millennia to their contemporary countries. Moreover, using present-day countries allows us to use the present-day language distribution statistics for each country to identify the main languages spoken in a country and determine the language affiliation of each person.
