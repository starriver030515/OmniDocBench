counteracting-ligand-induced spectral effects are likely to occur near 300 nm, first a large red shift corresponding to a conformational change of Trp120 and second a similar blue shift caused by other Trp residues. 
The Tyr116-Ala perturbation spectra also differed from that of wild-type GA. The characteristic trough at 282 nm was lacking with the three ligands tested (Fig. 9A-C), possibly due to the loss of the phenol chromophore of Tyr116. Moreover, Tyr116 seems to influence one or more Trp residues, since perturbation throughout the 295-320 nm region is decreased for Tyr116-Ala GA. Finally, the perturbation of the proposed catalytic base mutant Asp176-Asn GA induced31 by acetobose (1), retained the wild-type shape, although the intensity was slightly reduced (Fig. 10). 
Interaction of cyclomolino-oliposaccharides (cyclodextrins, CDs) at a second bind-ing site. — Typical tryptophan spectral perturbations with red shifts of decreasing intensities at 286, 294, and 303 nm were produced by complexation of GA1 with cyclomolino-hexose (αCD), -hexapase (βCD), and -octadec (γCD) (Fig. 11A). Tyr residue(s) were also affected, as apparent from the 278-281 nm peak (Fig. 11Aa). These features are clearly different from those obtained with the inhibitory ligands and suggest
