100 9 Fiscal Policy and Consolidation
by virtue of a credible fiscal adjustment, results in a drop in interest rates and an increase in the values of shares (Ardaga 2009). Correspondingly, a decrease in public spending that is viewed as permanent brings a positive wealth result: this positive result is greater than the decrease of current available income.
In contrast to expectations, the second theoretical view considers the channel for transmitting fiscal shocks to be the labor market. Hence, an adjustment can be expansionary if attempted through cuts in public spending because of its influence on private sector labor costs. Specifically, decreases in employment, public sector wages and unemployment benefits reduce the pressure exerted on the wage balance, resulting in positive consequences for the economy (Ardaga 2004).
The method for identifying the fiscal consolidations used in the aforementioned studies has been heavily criticized. The “standard method” identifies cases of large fiscal adjustments based on drops observed in the cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB). The basic argument against the method in question is that it increases the possibility of the analysis influencing support in favor of expansionary austerity (Romer 2011b; Guajardo et al. 2011). The cases of fiscal consolidation identified rely on observing a deficit drop; this drop may not be an outcome of deliberate efforts to restrain it by those exerting fiscal policy. Improvements in fiscal balances, for example, may be the result of asset price cycles (Girouard and Price 2004) influencing tax revenues. They may also be the outcome of one-off measures that do not reflect the overall policy stance (Koen and van den Noord 2005). This method is therefore considered an imperfect measure of discretionary policy actions.
Contrary to the aforementioned studies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF 2010) found results consistent with Keynesian predictions by examining the short-term repercussions of fiscal austerity on economic activity for 15 developed countries for the period 1980–2009. They used the “action-based approach” rather than the “standard approach”. This approach considers that incidents of large fiscal adjustments, for which the government adopted specific policy measures, are aimed at reducing deficits.
The negative consequence on economic activity is mitigated by a drop in interest rates and the depreciation of the real exchange rate following the adjustment. On one side, a drop in interest rates supports consumption and investment, whereas on the other side, real depreciation invigories net exports; real exports are increased while real imports are limited, reflecting an income decrease and a drop in domestic demand. Without the contribution of these two channels, the recession caused by austerity would be much deeper.
Krugman (2010a) claimed that the repercussions of the liquidity trap are not included in the analysis (this issue is examined in a subsequent section). He noted that the driving force for the economic blossoming following fiscal contraction cases identified in the past was mainly exports; these are not necessarily directly linked to a contraction policy. Romer and Romer (2010) took the side of criticism by coming up with results similar to those of the IMF; they concluded that all types of fiscal restraint bring short-term contractivity repercussions.
