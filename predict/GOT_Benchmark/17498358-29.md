Refer to Table SS for GDP per capita for the languages in our GLNs. These values are an approximation because the economic activity of a country is not distributed evenly by language. Moreover, a person may contribute in a language different than his or her native language: for example, many use English to communicate at their workplace although English is not their native language. Tables of GDP per capita and population by country and language are available on the SOM page. 
S3 Additional calculations 
In this section we briefly document two calculations used in the main text of the paper. First, we note that for all figures we use the number of multilingual speakers, or expressions, from a language. We estimate the number of multilingual speakers or expression from a language (N) as: 
N1 =∑M1 j 
I 
Also, we note that we estimate the eigenvector centrality of a language by using: 
A1x1 =∑M1 jx1 
and finding the eigenvector v, associated with the largest eigenvalue. Since the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue could be positive or negative, we take the absolute value of the elements of this eigenvector as our measure of a language’s eigenvector centrality.
