The subtrees (convx subalgebras/details) of a tree con-dition (S1, S2) 
stitute the dual of a median semilatrice in the sense of Scholendorf [12,13]; see also [7]. There exists a one-to-one correspondence between median semilatrices and median algebras. Thus, the logismatic LC(T) has a limited dis-tributivity property (a median algebras property). This implies that if S1 and S2 are two subtrees of T, and if S1 S2 exists, the distance from S1 to S2 through S1 ∧ S2 is the same as through S1 ∧ S2. Note that the distance in the logismatic LC(T) is the same as the distance in the (undirected) Hasset diagram graph G4 of LC(T).
As is well known, the eccentricity σ(v) of a point v in a connected graph G with the point set A. A and v be a point adjacent to a least central subtree C1, C2 and C3 are the same as
