CLINICAL GUIDELINE Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Acute Respiratory Tract Infection in Adults
antibiotics shorten the duration of sore throat by 1 to 2 days, but the benefit is modest and the number needed to treat to reduce symptoms is 6 after 3 days of treatment and 21 after 1 week of treatment (40). Evi-dence suggests that antibiotics may prevent complica-tions from group A streptococcal infection, including acute hemicemic fever (which is more common in chil-dren and adolescents than adults), peritonitis al-sores, and further spread of group A Streptococcus in outbreaks (40). However, little evidence supports the use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection (URT). Fewer than 2% of viral URTs AL-thoughts considered as a result of a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URT).

Adult patients with sore throat should be offered analgesic therapy, such as aspirin, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and third loca-tion of the respiratory tract, which is also recommended for chronic group A streptococci. The use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection is not recommended for chronic group A. Streptococ-cus carriers because they are unlikely to spread infec-tion to close contacts and are at little or no risk for complications. Tonalisclerotomy solely to reduce the fre-ciency of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in adults is not recommended (13).

The 2012 DSA clinical practice guidelines recom-mend empirical antibiotics as soon as a clinical diagno-sis of ARTS is established on the basis of clinical criteria (15). Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the preferred agent, and doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone may be used as an alternative in patients with ARTS. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery emphasizes watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial management for all patients with un-complicated ARTS, regardless of severity (16). Some professional societies, including the American Acad-emy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the Ameri-can Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery emphasizes watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial management for all patients with un-complicated ARTS, regardless of severity (17).
Acute Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Acute rhinosinusitis is usually a self-limited illness resulting from a viral infection, allergy, or irritant that causes inflammation of the mucosal tissue in the nasal and paranasal sinus cavity. Clinical symptoms include nasal congestion and obstruction, purulent nasal dis-charge, maxillary tooth pain, facial pain or pressure, febrile pain, and dryness, headache, and hallucinations. Symptom duration ranges from 3 to 33 days, with most episodes resolving within a week (41). More than 4.3 million adults are diagnosed with sinusitis annually, and more than 80% of ambulatory care visits result in an antibiotic prescrip-tion, most commonly a macrolide (42). Most antibiotic prescriptions for this condition are unnecessary (43).
Determining the Likelihood of a Bacterial Infection 
Acute rhinosinusitis is usually caused by a viral pathogen. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ARBS) is con-sidered to be a secondary infection resulting from ob-struction of the sinus ostia that leads to impaired mu-
