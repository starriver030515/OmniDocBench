15. And this is why beyond all creatures on Earth man is twofold; mortal because of body, but immortal because of the essential man. 
Though deathless and possessed of sway over all, yet does he suffer as a mortal does, subject to 
manifestation. 
Thus even though above the Harmony, within the Harmony he has become a slave. Though male-female, as from a Father male-female, and though he’s sleepiness from a sleepiness [Sire], yet is he overcome [by sleep]. 
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline Finally, we understand, from the very first act of creation down to the “contract” made between Mind and Nature, why Man is twofold: a mortal body, but an immortal Mind. Both above Fate, but subject to it. Though the Mind has no need to sleep, the body needs to sleep. In short, the treatise has explained not only the dual, but what many people have perceived as the contradictory nature of this reality.  \\

16. Thereon [I say: Teach on], O Mind of me, for I myself as well am amorous of the Word 
The Shepherd said: This is the mystery kept hidden until today. 
Nature embraced by Man brought forth a wonder, oh so wonderful. For as he had the nature of the Concord of the Seven, who, as I said to you, [were made] of Fire and Spirit - Nature delayed not, but immediately brought forth seven “men”, in correspondence with the natures of the Seven, male-female and moving in the air. 
Thereupon [I said]: O Shepherd, … for now I am filled with great desire and long to hear; do not run off. 
The Shepherd said: Keep silence, for not as yet have I unrolled for you the first discourse (logo). Lo! I am still, I said. 
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline The One confirms that the subject has now had this revelation. He adds further detail, stating that as to the “Seven Rulers”, made out of Fire and Spirit, Nature then decided to create seven “men”, the “physical transformation” of ‘the Fire-Spirit’. These seven physical beings were male-female, and moved in the air – in what some cultures would later call the Seven Archangels. This concludes the main lesson of the first class, but there is more to come.  \\

17. In such wise than, as I have said, the generation of these seven came to pass. Earth was as woman, her Water filled with longing; ripeness she took from Fire, spirit from Ether. Nature thus brought forth frames to suit the form of Man. 
And Man from Light and Life changed into soul and mind - from Life to soul, from Light to mind. And thus continued all the sense-world’s parts, until the period of their end and new beginnings.

\hline The One does an executive summary of what “we” are, repeating the nature of Man and his relationship with Nature.  \\

18. Now listen to the rest of the discourse (Logos) which you long to hear. 
The period having ended, the bond that bound them all was loosened by God’s Will. For all the animals being male-female, at the same time with Man were loosed apart; some became partly male, some in like fashion [partly] female. And straightway, God spoke by His Holy Word (Logos): “Increase yourself in increasing, and multiply in multitude, you creatures and creations all; and man that has Mind in him, let him learn to know that he himself is deathless, and that the cause of death is love, though Love is all.”
