CLINICAL GUIDELINE Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Acute Respiratory Tract Infection in Adults
In 2009, direct antibiotic prescription costs totaled $10.7 billion; 62% of these costs ($8.5 billion) were at-tributed to antibiotic prescribing in the community set-ting, followed by $3.6 billion in hospitals and $527 mil-lion in nursing homes and long-term care facilities (6). An estimated 50% of antibiotic prescriptions may be unnecessary or inappropriate in the outpatient setting (7) (Unpublished data. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), which estimates to more than $3 billion in excess costs. Over the past decade, antibiotic prescrip-tions for broad-spectrum antibiotics (flurociponolones and macrolides) have increased by at least 4-fold (8). Reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in the ambulatory setting is a public health priority.
This article by the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tion presents available evidence on the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics for adult patients with ARTI. The high-value care advice is intended to provide a guideline for prescribing antibiotics for adults with ARTI complications on appropriate antibiotic prescribing (9–19) and serves as an update of the 2001 Principles of Appropriate An-thiologic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract In-fections in Adults (9) and a complement to the pediatric principles published in 2013 (20). The target audience for this article is all clinicians providing care to adults seeking ambulatory care for ARTI.
METHODS
We conducted a narrative review of evidence about appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of pa-tients with ARTI syndromes, including acute uncompli-cated bronchitis, pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, and the common cold. We included current clinical guidelines from leading professional societies, such as the Infec-tious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Clinical guideline recommendations were augmented with evidence-based meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical guidelines for the treatment of bacterial and bacterial infections, and based articles, we conducted literature searches in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Medline, and EMBLE through September 2015. We included only English-language articles and used the following Medical Sub-ject Headings terms: “acute bronchitis,” “respiratory tract infection,” “pharyngitis,” “rhinosinusitis,” and “the common cold”. The focus of the article was limited to healthy adults without chronic lung disease (such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive lung disease) (10), and the focus was focused on the diagnosis of bronchitis (25, 26). Acute bronchitis leads to more inappropriate antibiotic pre-scribing than any other ARTI syndrome in adults (8).
Determining the Likelihood of a Bacterial Infection
More than 90% of otherwise healthy patients pre-senting to their outpatient providers with an acute cough have a syndrome caused by a virus (Table) (10, 21, 22). Nonviral pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydiabiliary pneumonia, are oc-casionally identified in patients with acute bronchitis (10), and Bordetella pertussis may be considered in sit-uations where transmission in the community has been reported. However, determining whether a patient has been exposed to the virus (see Table) and whether the patient has been exposed to the virus (see Table) is not a reliable predictor of the severity of the patient’s symptoms (Table).
This article was reviewed and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by the ACP High Value Care Task Force, whose members are physicians trained in internal medicine and its subse-calities and which includes experts in evidence synchro-sis. The Task Force developed the high-value care ad-vice statements, which are summarized in the Figure, based on the narrative review of the literature. At each conference call, all members of the High Value Care Task Force declared all financial and nonfinancial interests.
ACTIVE UNCOMPLICATED BRONCHITIS
Acute uncomplicated bronchitis is defined as a self-limited inflammation of the large airways (bronchiol) with a cough lasting up to 6 weeks. The cough may or may not be productive (24) and is often accompanied by mild constitutional symptoms. Acute bronchitis is among the most common adult outpatient diagnoses, including bronchitis, pneumonia, and pneumonia. The United States per year (8), more than 70% of which result in a prescription for antibiotics (25, 26). Ac
