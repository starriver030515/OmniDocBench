Isolation and Characterization 
by virtue of a cognitive factor approach, results in a drop in interest rates and an increase in the values of scores (Abramowitz 2002). Consequently, a decrease in public spending that is viewed as permanent brings a positive visual result: this positive result is greater than the decrease of current available income. 
In contrast to experiments, the second theoretical view considers the current for transmitting field signals to be the local media. Hence, an application can be experimentally if adopted through care in public spending because of its impact on private sector local costs. Specifically, decrease in employment, public sector wages and unemployment benefits reduce the pressure exerted on the wage burden, resulting in positive consequences for the economy (Abramowitz 2002). 
The method for identifying the field characteristics used in the experimental studies has been broadly defined. The “standard method” identifies cases of large field interactions known to make an increase observed in the eventually adopted public budget (COPB). The basic approach adopted the method in question is that it increases the possibility of the analysis independent variable in favor of experimental evidence (Rosenberg 2011; Günther et al. 2011). The cases of field correspondence identified rely on observing a different rate; this drop may not be an outcome of different efforts to respond it be they assume fixed probability. Implications in field budgets, for example, may be the result of even more cases (Günther and Fuchs 2002) including big changes. They may also be the outcome of one-off observations that do not reflect the overall policy status (Rosen and van der Meer 2008). This method is therefore considered an important measure of descriptive policy actions. 
Consider to the experimental studies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF 2011) found results consistent with Keynesian predictions by examining the short-term consequences of field activity on economic activity for 15 developed countries for the period 1999–2008. They used the “active-based approach” rather than the “standard approach”. This approach considers that impacts of large field interactions, for which the government adopted specific policy measures, are aimed at reducing deficits. 
The negative consequence on economic activity is included by a drop in interest rates and the development of the real exchange rate following the adoption. On one side, a drop in interest rates supports consumption and investment, whereas on the other side, real development impacts also: real exports are increased while real imports are limited, reducing an increase decrease and a drop in domestic demand. Without the combination of these two qualities, the response cannot be achieved would be much greater. 
Kohlenberg (2010) claimed that the consequences of the financial risk are not included in the analysis (this issue is explained in a subsequent section). He noted that the driving force for the economic welfare following field correspondence came determined in the past two mutually active; these are not necessarily directly linked to a continuing policy. Rosenberg and Rosenberg (2010) took the case of education by going up with results similar to those of the IMF; they concluded that all types of field correspondence bring short-term consequences respectively.
