After dividing results with an appropriate place of birth we identified with 10, 775 peopleâ€”to which we refer historically as the Whitehead 25 division.

To increase the accuracy of the estimate, we selected from the Whitehead 25 division only the 4,754 people who were born after 1900 and before 1900. 
Table 7.1 and 7.2 show the number of families people for each country and language, respectively.
