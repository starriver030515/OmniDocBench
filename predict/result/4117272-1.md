COMMERCIAL CHEMISTRY
In 2003, other pharmaceutical science groups joined with the US Food and Drug Administration Task Force, whose members are providing training in industrial chemistry and its subse-quents and which members assist in ongoing subse-quent workshops. The Task Force discussed the high-value end-user services, which are supported in the Food and Drug Administration Task Force, whose members are providing training in industrial chemistry and its subsequents and which members assist in ongoing subse-quent workshops. The Task Force described the high-value end-user services, which are supported in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Research involving applications involving the environment is a public health initiative.
