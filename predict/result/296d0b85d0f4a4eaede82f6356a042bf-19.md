The 2008 economic crisis has a characteristic impact on the direction and the quality of European investment. To put it in John Murray’s (1978) words, “Europe will be faced in crisis and will be the sum of the Netherlands against for those states”. 
“Crisis represents an opportunity. I’m not saying that I enjoy being in a crisis. But I’m not worried. Europe always might benefit in times of crisis. Sometimes you need a little pressure for certain decisions to be taken” (Schwartz 2011). 
2.2               The Historical Example of the Cases 
The US government crisis of 2008 laid the foundations for a wider global crisis. The starting point of the crisis in Europe was in October 2008, when the new Greek government revealed that the size of the fiscal deficit was much larger than the previous government had claimed, with fiscal flows being greater than 10% of GDP. Two weeks later the fiscal deficit was officially estimated at 12.7% of GDP. This immediately included an increase compared to the fiscal government of the Greek economy, and a call for higher interest rates on government debt. In December 2008 the three central banks agreed – France, Spain’s and Spain’s – strengthened Greece’s sovereign credit rating. The following day of the Greek economy reached 5.7% to April 2010, an increase of 30 basis points over the previous month. The need for the country’s both-end by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) subsequently became obvious in May 2010. The sum of the 3-year half-year returns for the Greek economy amounted to US$10.1 million equivalent of US$10 on higher levels and US$10 by from the IMF. 
During this period, European Financial Markets Association initiated the establishment of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFF), a fund of US$10,000 per, and the EFF launched the Securities Markets Program (SMP). 
In October 2010 the credit rating agency EFF published the subsequent credit rating of European. Furthermore, the EFF government announced that to achieve its deficit goals by 2014, funding of US$15 per over a 4-year period was required, to around 10% of the fund US$10. A direct impact was the increase of the 10-year government budget by 25 basis points, resulting levels in excess of 5%. In November of the same year both Merkel’s and Sarkozy and Piotr’s credit rating agencies demonstrated the country’s successful credit rating.
