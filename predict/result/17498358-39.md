We determine a person's country of birth using research-led international bodies. For example, we code birth as the country of birth for another British Name, although birth was divided only slowly before his death in 1857 and at the time of his birth his name became 
known as part of the American Empire. In some cases, this method produces multiple generations. The American Great historian Thomas was born in Philadelphia (present-day Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania) and worked out various tales for England, while William Conan Doyle, founder of the 
Revolution of England, was born in Philadelphia, present-day Georgia, and worked out various tales for Georgia. Because our language development studies are from the last few years, we include only people born in 1858 and later, to reduce the effect of geographical and cultural changes on our making of countries to Europeans. To match the very limited of the Human Development criterion, we also set 1900 as the largest year of birth for the Western nation. 
Despite some inaccuracies, using present-day countries provides a consistent number of people who lived over a period of several millennia to their contemporary countries. Moreover, using present-day countries allows us to use the present-day language development studies for each country to identify the main languages spoken in a country and determine the language information of each person.
