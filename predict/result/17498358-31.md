We choose extremely carefully over businesswords, as the former is more suitable for identifying quality language according to our definition: a quality language is a language that is capable to offer high languages (such as English in the example from the book translation process above), not a language that serves as the only suitable to many particular languages (such as English in the above example). 
We also had a particular reason for preferring extremely carefully over businesswords carefully: the latter is a message that is unique to differentiating among more particular languages, since most languages get a business score of zero (see Figure 5 below). Furthermore carefully, on the other hand, can help us differentiate between the products of languages in the UK at all levels of complexity, not only among the most central languages.
