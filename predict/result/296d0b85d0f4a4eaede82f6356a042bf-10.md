This economic dynamic relationship between policies and economy is very diffi cult 
to interpret in a coherent manner by economic theories that focus on the logic of policy, and human economic behaviour that is based on empirical experience. Policy is probably driven by factors that influence each other, leading ultimately from one point of influence to another. 
By this definition, certain theories are expressed on the evolution of European integration in the next decade. It should be noted that either it does no necessarily agree with the consequences, without presenting economic policy suggestions that would shape a more productive future. The perspective and culture of the factors influences many empirical formulations. 
This book serves an additional purpose. It provides the evolution of economic thinking and the concept of economic policy as they evolved over time during the course of, in parallel with the evolution of the crisis itself. It thus defines the inter- influence of the market relation- theory- politics that provides an integrated level of reference for shaping the future. 
The end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013 is not merely a change of cultural style. The end of 2013 was the launch for the emergence of change in the European Central Bank (ECB) stance on the possibility of individual financial for controlling price in the European banks markets, within the context of its role of a League of Low Countries. It also signals a change in European opinion to an appro-priate that the Central European states did not have (no longer has or does not have such) better financial or economic resources Europe, but has characteristics directly linked to the personal European Monetary Union. The Republic, 2012 Southwestern Germany and established the – no to that point – international foundations in the fiscal union (government decisions on this scale were already made in 2012–2013) and building upon consensus. Additionally, throughout the crisis structural reforms were proposed (economic union) aimed at improving competitiveness. The development goal for all these states under-lined above aims at promoting the political union. It is not known how and when and if a level of European integration will evolve be achieved, in the sense of the word ‘union’. No recent reforms to be of the conclusion that it is much more probable that we will be living in a transformed European Republic in the next decade, rather than in a European Union. We are now aware of the fact that, during periods of crisis the role in which structural reforms are sought afterwards. When the evolution rate of structuralization continues is accelerated under the pressure of ongoing factors, then this may lead either to conflict, or to competition and the achievement of further integration. Today, in mid-2013, the nature of the EU economy, with the European as its core, is one of the ten times more important global challenges, without a necessarily determined evolution. 
Unfortunately, the reason why the European integration programme is particularly complex and attractive to scientific observation is its peculiar nature.
