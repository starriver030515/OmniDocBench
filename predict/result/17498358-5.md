evolutionary Bayesian Rule, do not represent regressors that can be used to map covariance between global languages. 
The errors that participate of the Bayes, Wilmot and body functions are not representative of the entire human population, yet still represent changes that are worthy of study since errors often cross the original, potential, historical, and economic processes with which observers of global language patterns are concerned. 
Considering these Global Language Variables 
To consider the three global language variables we need to first identify the links that are statistically significant with respect to the probability of success associated in each of the three domains. A statistically significant correlation is a correlation where the probability of finding a specific, or related, connecting languages / and / is larger than what we would expect based on the probability of these languages alone (Eq-1-7/Eq-1-8). Here, we use the e-correlation and/or regressors to assess the statistically significant of language correlations. 
Let N1 be the number representing the number of users, or participants, from language / to language /. Then the correlation N1 between languages / and / is given by: 
N1N1N1N1N1N1N1N1N1N1 (1) 
where N1 represents the number of mathematical users (or participants) expressed in language / (N1 = N2N1) and N2 represents the total number of users or participants in the domain. N1 is positive for languages that tend to co-occur more than what we would expect based on their representation in a domain, and negative otherwise. To assess the statistically significant of these correlations we use the E-correlation, which is given by: 
E1 = N2N1 + E2 = (1) 
(2) 
where E1 = 2 represents the degree of freedom of the correlation. Here we consider E1 very small (N1, N2) since this provides a more suitable criterion for finding a correlation than using E1.
